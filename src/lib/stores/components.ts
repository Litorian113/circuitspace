		description: 'A versatile microcontroller board based on the ATmega32U4 with built-in USB communication.',
		detailedDescription: 'The Arduino Leonardo is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega32U4. It has 20 digital input/output pins, a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a micro USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. Unlike other Arduino boards, the Leonardo can act as a USB device, making it ideal for projects that need to emulate keyboards, mice, or other USB devices.',

		workingPrinciple: 'The Leonardo runs programs stored in its flash memory. It can communicate directly with a computer via USB without needing an additional USB-to-serial chip. The ATmega32U4 has built-in USB communication, allowing it to appear as various USB devices like keyboards, mice, or serial ports.',
		safetyTips: [
			'Never exceed the input voltage range of 7-12V',
			'Avoid short circuits between power pins',
			'Use appropriate current limiting for LEDs and other components',
			'Be careful with the micro USB connector - it can break with excessive force',
			'Always disconnect power before wiring connections',
			'Use pull-up resistors for reliable digital inputs'
